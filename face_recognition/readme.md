# Webcam Face Recognition App

This project uses OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library to create a simple face recognition system. It allows you to use a webcam to detect and identify faces in real-time by comparing them with reference images stored in a folder. If a known face is detected, the app displays the corresponding name; otherwise, it labels the face as "Unknown".

## Features
- Detect faces in real-time using a webcam.
- Compare detected faces with a set of reference images.
- Draw rectangles around detected faces and display names.
- Display a live webcam feed with face recognition.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
